The code is incredibly messy and will not work on your machine without modifications. There are many fixes specific to my computer---use at your own risk. Major parts are borrowed from [Aylur's dotfiles](https://github.com/Aylur/dotfiles) with changes. To run, you need to install the following:

- Hyprland (tested on 0.27.0 with Ubuntu and 0.36.0 with Debian)
- ags widgets
- wofi
- kitty
- fish (optional)

To open terminal, press `SUPER + Q`. To start the top bar, press `SUPER + V`. To close a window, press `ALT + Q`. All other shortcuts can be found and changed in `hypr/binds.conf`.
